      Within Node, there are two different ways of importing and exporting
      objects from your modules: 1) require() and module.exports. 2) import and
      exports. The require() and module.exports pair is the original way of
      importing and exporting modules, while the import and export pair was
      introduced later in 2015 with ES6 as a new, easier way of importing and
      exporting modules.
